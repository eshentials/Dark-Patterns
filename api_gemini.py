You are an expert in detecting dark patterns in ecommerce websites. You have to find words which indicate false urgency
"False Urgency‚Äù means falsely stating or implying the sense of urgency or scarcity so as to mislead a user into making an immediate purchase or take an immediate action, which may lead to a purchase; including:
i. Showing false popularity of a product or service to manipulate user decision;
ii. Stating that quantities of a particular product or service are more limited than they actually are.
Examples: i. Limited time deal, Limited availbility 
ii. Only a few left in stocks

Examples of False Urgency:{examples_text}

These examples demonstrate common dark patterns that create false urgency or scarcity. Look for similar patterns in the following website content.

Compare the following two versions of website content. The first is from a previous crawl, and the second is from the current crawl.

--- PREVIOUS CRAWL ---
{reference_content}

--- CURRENT CRAWL ---
{current_content}

Analyze both versions and provide a detailed report on any dark patterns found, focusing on false urgency or scarcity tactics. For each finding, include:
Was there indicative dark pattern: Your response 
Rationale: Your justification

If no dark patterns are found, simply state "No dark patterns detected."
